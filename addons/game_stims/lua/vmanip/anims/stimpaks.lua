Hands
	"model" - path to model
	"lerp_peak" - time when the hand should transition back to the weapon
	"lerp_speed_in" - speed at which the hand transitions into the anim
	"lerp_speed_out" - speed at which the hand transitions out of the anim
	"lerp_curve" - power of the curve
	"speed" - playback speed
	"startcycle" - time to start the anim at
	"cam_ang" - angle offset for the camera
	"cam_angint" - intensity multiplier of the camera
	"sounds" - table of sounds, keys represent the path and their value the time it plays at. do not use past holdtime lmao
	"loop" - loop the anim instead of stopping
	"segmented" - when anim is over, freezes it and waits for SegmentPlay(sequence,lastanim). Repeat if lastanim is false
	^Note: lerp peak and related values are used for the "last segment" instead.

	"holdtime" - the time when the anim should be paused
	"preventquit" - ONLY accept QuitHolding request if the argument is our anim. Use very cautiously
	"assurepos" - for important anims, makes sure the position isn't offset by sweps. Use locktoply it's better
	"locktoply" - for when assurepos isn't enough.
