====== "The Making Of" Document ======
FS2R was designed on these pillar in order
-Art 
-Uniqueness
-Functionality
-Brainless Fun
-"Im the best fucker in the world"

in addition to that this was made to hone my skill in editing of animation, models and topology 

The ART side of things:
this is how you get people to use your shit in the first place, fucking visual, be it animation (which i do not have controls over in this one) and how it looks      
my design is simple
cold war and prototype theme
lots of freedom and not bound to the bullshit "factory made standard" bullshit of the modern era
sure i throw in a few modern weapon here and there (roni, mass26) but they still follows the core of the theme
[end]

The UNIQUENESS side of things:
this is how you get people to keep using your shit and not uninstall after one session, it has to have some sort of feature(s) that stands out in the sea of trash
mine has a lot
+the amount of bullshit attachment
+akimbo
+roni 
+super short barrel
+suppressed barrel that isnt just thicc shrouded barrel lo (most of the time at least)
[end]

The FUNCTIONALITY side of things:
I have no controls or knowledge on this,
I'm glad to have fesiug and 8z carry my ass and make a lot of feature possible.
[end]

The FUN side of things:
can i just say this?
FUCK REALISM IN VIDEO GAME
YOURE IN A FUCKING GAME DUMBASS
NO SHIT DEV GONNA TWEAK STUFF TO MAKE IT MORE FUN FOR THE USER END
CUNT
if you want to go outside and die a horrible death cuz muh realism go ahead 

havent you notice but i put this pretty low cuz well this is more like a challenge for me so fun comes last
[end]

---------------------
In short: the uniqueness gets them to come, the functionality gets them to stay, the art gets them to comeback to
---------------------



The EGO side of things:
the sole purpose 
my initial purpose
of choosing fas2 instead of animating from the ground up
is to prove that
ARCTIC IS A FUCKING DUMBASS
it is quite funny you know
we both use others people assets
he uses CSGO and INS2
i use FAS2 and KF2 (and alot of other stuff)
he only makes quanity (lotsa gun but very meh)
he is bounded by the context of the mod (i think) of modern era/standardisation,
i use kitbash/makeshift/prototype freely cuz it makes sense in the context of the mod (cold war/prototype theme), hence it explain the jungle shroud, conversion kit and so on. therefore alot of creative freedom
[end]


so whats the point of this
always give the artist the control 
the coder can handle the techincality but the artist MUST handle the core 





moral of the story?
if youre a coder then learn to art
if youre an artist then to code 
those are the two end of the spectrum that you must master in order to achive "perfection"

meanwhile i cant code a single thing so im just gonna suck datae and 8z whenever i could

this guy sums it up best
