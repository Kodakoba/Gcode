-references, sorry i forgot to bookmark all the artist i stole     :/


slogkot:
-Concept [partially] (IMR, SeRv-45, APX-10, Leviathan, RDV-10G)
-Concept [factually] (DB-14, AWRX-6, Adler-442, VT0R-5, RMB-17, Raptor-67, FR-60, AICW, Omega-75D, every npc weapons) -- im getting good at this
-Reticle Design --- made with blender trolololololo !!11!!11!            even tho i have 2d design programme 
-Models
-"Textures" ---- palettes are still texture i swear !111!1!
-Animations
-C_hands
-Npc ---- the heads at least
-Literally everything
-Firing sounds "mixing" (i swear combining two sound with no blending is the professional way)
-Leviathan sounds (with actual proper sound mixing bullshit)

-------------
all the foley, aside from the Leviathan is from mw19
the Leviathan sound is mixed from hla, (strider, gunship and manhack)
the firing sounds are mixed from mw19, iw, and sometimes hla (the small electric charge is from iw or hla, trail and boom boom is usually from mw)
-------------


im so sorry for the coding logic stuff like the akimbo and the rmb17 ubgl

Design, Role Explain Thing: (chrononical order)
FX-92: f2000 + (xm8/g36), i want a bulky ar to fit "late game" tier slow firing kinda battle rifle bullshit, 40 round cuz fuck you
		but had to nerf it so it wouldnt just beat every other thing so the reload is even longer than a belt fed, might nerfed it too hard, idk
AWRX-6: (m590/mass26) + (arx/scar/zh06), "mid game" tier weapon, basically your bitch boy generic assault rifle #20451112155
		underbarrel shotgun cuz im buck main deal with it		- dont call this a m4 thing, i dont even have any m4 ref for this one, xcept the irons i guess
DB-14: (spas/marlin), i want a spas, i also want a m1887, you can see the rest of my thought process
Adler-442: rsh12 + that one weird looking ass carbine revolver on google images, i want revolver for novelty but im also missing dmr role
H4WK-18: just a g3 with like 2 parts of a cetme lc, for some reason i wanted to Do a g3, and i hate myself so enjoy the anim		- fr doe theres like 0 different between a cetme and a g3 lmao, they all look the same
APX-10: apc9 + ump, original draft has xm8 parts but i had to scrap it, i want some hk vector, Close enough
VT0R-5: sten mk5 but not, i want side fed mag, i want an actual lmg belt, i want another fast firing, i want MW19 FiNN, therefore- this
RMB-17: (an94/amb16) "late game-ish" tier suppressed weapon, i dont want to Do some bitch boy mp5sd and i swore to not include an ak, and im missing actual explosive-y anti tank weapon
	   so i look at a bunch of ak derivatives and a famas, the rpg concept is from the obviously well known concept, rest is a mash of amb16, an94, that one finnish and hugarian ak, with "cool parts" from an ak12 and cz805,
	   heres a funi origin concept story, this was orginally an anti tank weapon, bascially a hyper bust m82, the original has more aps parts with its thicc ass mag and a m82 muzzle brake, then i realised how useless it is
Leviathan: fish but one of them cage spine thinggie like dolphin and not vertical? flat spine thinggie like trout
Raptor-67: i hate shotgun, so not even break action
FR-60: burst sucks but famas good
AICW: 	its a real thing apparently, well not the half open grenade tube bullshit
		idk If its just me but i couldnt Find a single refernce for how this thing work, just a vague silhouette so i have no idea how the "advance" icw works since it has one mag and 2 barrels
		"A" stands for advance, not kiwi, i think,   so just oicw but aussie trademark free
Omega-75D: i really want a stealth-ish Type of gun with a knife, and i hate pistol so the loudest, most inaccurate gun integrally suppressed and super accurate
RDV-10G: back when i first start modelling, one of the main immediate reason i started was to Do a shotgun speed loader cuz aside from bo4, ive NEVER seen one for some reason

Shit in need of redesign
IMR
SeRv-45 ????
R60 (scope)
AICW Irons




the focus of FS2R was how much shit can i add to an existing gun before burnout
the focus of Tuna is how much shit can i design/make before boredom 
therefore, individual customisation like fas2 -as much as i want- is not and will not be a thing
im tired of stealing, this is my attempt to create something all by me
as long as you dont count concept art and sounds 

this project is a direct fuck you to all the gun cunts out there
to show that m4s and aks (and guns in general)* are boring pieces of trash that should never exist
and how people are wrong to bash an art form that derives too much from the little cozy familiarity of genericallity (is that a word? fuck is a noun of generic???)
i wish games would stop including generic shit like m4s and aks 
i fucking hate how every bloody game no matter how far to the future or past MUST have a fucking ak
kinda broke my own philosophy with the awxr6 but oh well it is based on an arx, which is just an italian m4 :/




why Do i have all these dev blog for big projects? self reflection
to see how far i has changed in both my goal and my philosophy over the course of a project 

and looking back, i see i was truly a retard
but at least my scopes are still some what feasible
my only enemy is Time and boredom 
and my own will i guess


Current Philosophy

The more unconventional looking the better
The more conventional it is the weirder the reload gets
Fast-ish Pace reload, each with its own style so you never feel the same thing (kinda failed)
Realism = Fail
EACH MUST BE UNIQUE, BE IT STATS OR VISUAL
Visual comes first doe

List of failures:
IMR [visual]-- generic, indistinguishable
APX-10 [visual, stats] -- generic, indistinguishable
SeRv-45 [visual, stats] -- generic, indistinguishable
HL-877 [stats]-- burst is never good, also reused anim
Adler-442 [stats]-- damage is ass but it has to be ass, cant find a work around without making it one shot kill
Akimbo [???]--- its one of those thing that feels good on monday and shit on the rest
Raptor-67 [???]--- its another shotgun therefore instantly bad
